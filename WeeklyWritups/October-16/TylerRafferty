Tyler Rafferty 10/16 writeup
I was on the Windows AD team
We were on machine 410 

What we did:
Downloaded windows 2019 OS
Made a backup copy 
Tried to setup AD on windows but got stuck
Stuck on the prerequisites check because of used ports
Budget usage on shared doc

After meeting:
I setup AD on my own VM
Did not have the same error
